      <h1 class="title">Why you should get stairlifts in your home?</h1>

      <p><span style="margin-left:70px;"></span>
        A stairlift is often a practical and cost-effective option to improving your home, as well
        as meaning you will need to make less of a change to your
        lifestyle as would be witnessed if you considered living downstairs or moving
        out of your property completely.</p><br />
      <p>
        People with limited mobility who find it difficult to walk up and down staircases are sure to find stairlifts very handy.
        This includes individuals with significantly reduced strength and flexibility from old age, as well as those who have had
        a hip replacement and people with conditions like arthritis or a heart problem.

    <h1 class="title2">Here's what are clients are saying:</h1>

    <div class="mySlides">
      <p>"Searched the internet to find a chairlift company. I heard from Acorn within minutes of my contact online.
        Within the week a sales person came to my home. He was very knowledgeable and helpful in making the decision
        to purchase a Acorn Stairlift. The stairlift was installed by a very professional, friendly, polite engineers.
        They were amazing."</p>

    <div class="mySlides">
      <p>"Acorn had best presentation and best design idea for our curved staircase. 2 other companies we got bids
        were using unfamiliar subcontractors. A local Med equipment company discouraged us from even thinking about
        it because stairlifts were unreliable and they had quit installing them. The primary reason we went with
        Acorn was dealing directly with the Mfg and Acorn Employees. No Subcontractors. So far, the thing is working well!"</p>

    <div class="mySlides">
      <p>"It's great. It allows me to access our cellar which is finished. We have an office, schwinn bicycle, treadmill, TV, pool
        table, Universal exercise set up, washer/dryer layout table and a large workshop. So you can see how valuable this
        charilift is for us."</p>
